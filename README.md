# Web Development Project 1 - *Community Board*

Submitted by: **Ayush Bhandari**

This web app: **This application functions as a simple visual guide to restaurants in Cincinnati. A user is greeted by a large header image of the Cincinnati skyline with the title "Restaurants in Cincinnati". Below this, the app displays a grid of individual cards, where each card represents a different local restaurant. Each card provides key information at a glance, including a photo of the establishment, its name, and the type of cuisine it serves, such as "Italian" or "Steakhouse". For users interested in learning more, every card includes a "Visit Website" button that directs the user to that specific restaurant's official website.**
